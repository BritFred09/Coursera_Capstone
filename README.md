# Coursera Capstone

These are all the files created during my Coursera Data Science coursework. The Final Project for this course I completed was utilization of Python to 1) quickly analyze venue data in Toronto neighborhoods to optimize the selection of SKUs for a potential Wholesale Distribution business and 2) select an optimal location for this Wholesale Distribution in close proximity to the aforementioned venues. Please see "final proj.pdf" to view the final project.

Python packages and tools used: BeautifulSoup, Foursquare API, Pandas, Numpy, Requests
